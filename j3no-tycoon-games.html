Growing up I loved Zoo Tycoon 1 and 2, it may be my favorite series of all time. My memories of it are rose tinted but just the creativity possible in creating a zoo and populating it with animals that ate and roamed and reproduced was awesome. https://i.imgur.com/XlDpGpq.jpg I know people love the Roller Coaster Tycoon series as well, though I never played those games. (I'm much more interested in the zoo concept with a ton of animal species that interact than building rollercoasters.) Recen. Zoo tycoon includes downloadable content and endangered species theme pack. Zoo tycoon 2 includes African adventure, endangered species, and a few animals from marine mania. If you see mistakes, fell free to point them out. (?) means it is an animal the community guessed from a Planet Zoo picture and is not a 100% identification. amp#x200B; Animals Zoo Tycoon Zoo Tycoon 2 Wildlife Park 3 Zoo Tycoon Ultimate Planet Zoo :- :- :- :- :- :- Lions x x Asiatic x Barbary. 
As a follow-up to my Chart of Animals From the Zoo Tycoon games and Known Planet Zoo animals (https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetZoo/comments/blwmv6/chart_of_animals_from_the_zoo_tycoon_games_and/) I have created a Google sheet that last all the animals in the Zoo Tycoon games, all the wildlife Park games, and Planet Zoo. This includes all the aquatic animals but not the extinct animals for now. I plan on adding an alphabetical list of all the animals soon. amp#x200B; I love tycoon/management games where you need to start up a business and (micro)manage a lot of the details to try and make it a success. Lately I've been looking for a new Tycoon game like that which keeps being a challenge when you progress further into the game as it sometimes feels like when you progress it gets super easy and more like a "grind". Some of the games I've been playing: \- SimAirport \- Software Inc - Love how in depth this game is but after developing my first big piece. This is a copy paste from another subreddit I posted on. A few years back, I played Game Dev Tycoon. It was a brilliant game and I enjoyed playing it. In fact, I went back to play it several times over the years. After wanting to find similar games to play, I also played The Movies, a similar game but with a different style. I've been thinking of coming back to this game but I was wondering what other games are out there similar to these two. One genre that I am searching for is a music-based. I'm looking for a good, small-scale idea for a tycoon game. Most of the tycoon games I've ever wanted to play (including the really niche ones) already exist. So I'd like to ask r/tycoon, what games do you want to play that don't already exist? Ideas I've already floated around: - Alchemists' shop - Lemonade Stand - Movie theatre. I've always been interested in making games, and business sims and tycoons are a big favorite of mine. I am not so interested in building some engine from scratch or figuring out a lot of the heavy lifting parts of the coding and would rather focus on actually developing assets and designing the front-end systems that the player interacts with. I don't believe I've seen a program specifically for these type of games though. I know there's generic ones like Game Maker which would probably. 
Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 and 3 were both fantastic games because they offered a great building system. I never really enjoyed dealing with money or customer satisfaction, though. I tried Cities Skylines, but without using a bunch of mods and save hacking, it's not possible to remove all of the management elements from the game. I want a game with a fantastic building system. No money concerns, traffic jams, fires, election BS or random alien invasions. Just pure creative. I'm not sure if 'non linear' is the best way to describe what I'm looking for, however the typical management/tycoon game on mobile gaming is where you start off small, then invest to grow, let the cash build up, then invest to grow. Rinse and repeat. Success has very little to do with what choices you make. There is always a glass cieling that rises as you go through the game. What I'm looking for is more of a sandbox management game, such as the football manager series. In football manager. Moves licence plate-crash Moves diffuser-crash Moves badge-crash 3 crashes Games like Planet Coaster and Cities: Skyline have a really solid mixture of management/simulation PLUS customization where you can really customize the entire look + feel of things. What are some other games I‚Äôm still in the early stages and have a lot to work on, but I see there is a huge want for a zoo building game in this subreddit! I just found this sub reddit and I‚Äôm so glad I can share my love for tycoon games with you all. My website is and I have a playable version on the website. I‚Äôm open to feedback and if any coders or designers wanted to pitch in and help, please message me üòä I need ideas on how to increase replayability 
I am one of the few people who enjoyed Sim City Online, in part for the online play, city specialization, and production/supply gameplay. Are there any games in the wide tycoon genre that have taken this further and had a massively-multiplayer world? Wondering how that would even work. I feel like it would need a way for abandoned buildings (i.e. the player hasn't logged-in in a while) to be reclaimed. Only one I can think of is turmoil. When I played RCT 3, I really liked the little food stands you could set up and had a lot of fun customizing prices for food and watching my income increase from them.
